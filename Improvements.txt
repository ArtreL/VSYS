Possible Improvements

- Check specified path for syntax!
- Whenever multiple Inputs, that are clearly not 1024 characters long, are sent, 
  gather them and send them with a unique delimiter all at once.
- On the client side, when an operation is chosen, don't wait for the respective
  case from a send/receive, but simply step into the specified case.
- Instead of swapping the buffer char array and the temp string constantly,
  check if maybe a string.c_str() is accepted by the send function as well.
